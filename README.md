# Keep-App 
A note keeper webpage that is similar to “Google keep” using React, Node and Javascript.
It can be used to create a new note, which has a title and a content.
The webpage also displays all the notes and provides functionality to delete the notes.
To run this project we will need the node modules installed including body-parser and express.
